# X-Plane 12 scenery_packs.ini updater
# Run this script to scan your Custom Scenery folder for any changes against the scenery_packs.ini file and automatically update it when changes are found.
# Pretty simple concept, right?

# Early Merry Christmas to all and Happy New Year!
# YMMV -- BE SURE TO SET YOUR $CustomSceneryPath BEFORE RUNNING THE SCRIPT (or expecting it to work, for that matter...)

# Version 2.8 (sleepbeuponme)
# - Fixed path redundancy issue (no more double "Custom Scenery").
# - Standardized paths: full paths use backslashes (Z:\), inside Custom Scenery uses forward slashes (/).
# - Better handling of missing folders â€“ no more false positives.
# - Backup of scenery_packs.ini made BEFORE any changes.
# - Improved path formatting consistency and clearer logs.
# - Added safety checks to avoid unnecessary changes.
# - Broke the script to the point where now it will no longer run because it is bitching about paths and I hate slashes now. I'm going to bed.
# Version 2.7 (paperboy)
# - Added handling for non-existent folder references in scenery_packs.ini.
# - If a folder reference is missing, prompt the user to delete or keep the entry.
# - Ensured all conflicts are handled interactively with options to resolve them.
# - Preserved the order of entries and avoided duplicates in the updated scenery_packs.ini.
# - Backup of scenery_packs.ini created before any changes.
# - Fixed minor path formatting issues for consistency.
# Version 2.6 (up-and-up)
# - Inserted new folders directly above the first SCENERY_PACK line.
# - Preserved line breaks in scenery_packs.ini for better formatting.
# - Ensured no duplicate entries and sorted the final list of folders.
# - Backup of the existing scenery_packs.ini file is created before applying any changes.
# - Fixed path formatting issues when checking folder existence.
# Version 2.5 (hooray)
# - Fixed insertion of new folders to the correct location (line 3).
# - Ensured line breaks in scenery_packs.ini file are preserved.
# - Removed any unnecessary slashes and maintained consistent path formatting.
# Version 2.4 (doggoneit)
# - Fixed path formatting: directories in Custom Scenery now get formatted properly.
# - Drive-letter paths (C:\, Z:\) are left unmodified.
# - Updated handling for directories and added missing folders.
# Version 2.3 (headbang)
# - More work on the duplication bug.
# - Modified $NormalizedLine to ensure the paths are using forward slashes.
# - $NewContent now processed using 'Sort-Object -Unique'
# Version 2.2 (ragequit)
# - Fixed handling for *GLOBAL AIRPORTS*
# - Squashed a logic error that caused a major duplication issue.
# - Added an exit condition outside of the interactivity/user decision flow.
# Version 2.1 (slurpee)
# - Added handling for *GLOBAL AIRPORTS* even though I'm not exactly sure of its significance.
# Version 2.0 (brainblast)
# - Added a check to detect if there are no changes needed; script exits if all scenery folders are already referenced.
# - Created a temporary "comparison_cache.txt" file to aid in comparison, which is deleted after processing.
# - Backup of the existing scenery_packs.ini file is created before applying any changes.
# - Improved user prompts to confirm adding missing folders and optional review of the updated ini file.
# - Ensured the script only modifies the ini file if discrepancies are detected.
# Version 1.1
# - Specified *my* Custom Scenery folder path.
# Version 1.0
# - Initial release.
